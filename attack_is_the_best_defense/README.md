# Attack is the best defense
This project focuses on network security and explores different techniques to understand vulnerabilities and potential risks. The tasks in this project aim to demonstrate the importance of securing network traffic and the potential consequences of unencrypted communication.

## Task 0: ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic
In this task, we will explore the concept of ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic. By intercepting network traffic and redirecting it to a malicious machine, an attacker can analyze the information for potential sensitive data. We will not perform ARP spoofing in this project, but we will start by sniffing unencrypted traffic to extract information.

## Task 1: Dictionary attack
In this task, we will explore the vulnerability of password-based authentication systems by performing a dictionary attack. We will target an SSH account and attempt to brute force it using a password dictionary.
